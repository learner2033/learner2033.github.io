    <p class="blog-paragraph">Hey there! <b>Asjad</b> here, an average person and someone who wants to achieve a lot of things in life but is in dilemma whether he'll be able to achieve them or not. To be honest, I don't know myself ,who am I!<br> Sometimes I overestimate myself and sometimes I undervalue myself.<br> Albeit I am an average person in every aspect of life be it personality, sports, studying, and the list goes on... <br> 2021 was the year when I passed my High school examination and 2 years have gone by and I am still preparing for an entrance examination for admission in <i>Medical school</i> called <i>NEET</i>.<br> Yes, this is my 2nd drop and currently I am a NEET aspirant. At the start of preparation I was confident enough but as time passed the dream I once thought is in my grasp is now beyond me. I don't know what to do now.<br> I once thought I might take admission in MIT after graduation but for an average person like me it's just a pipe dream and nothing else.<br>
        <b><em>Again my English is average or might be below average. So, please feel free to correct me. I'll try to improve my English along with me.</em></b><br>

        Today I learned about how to use browser developer tools, developing websites outside Khan Academy, hosting website on a Github server.Since I am a learner I named my website <a href="https://learner2033.github.io/" target="_blank"><em>learner2033.gitnhub.io</em></a>. Khan academy is an all-purpose platform in the educational field. I fell in love with this platform since Day 01. Currently I am aspiring to be a Software Engineer.I promise to myself;<br>
        <br>
        <em class="software">IF I DIDN'T MAKE IT INTO MEDICAL COLLEGE I WILL SURELY BECOME A SOFTWARE ENGINEER AND JOIN ONE OF THE TOP TECH COMPANIES <b>IN SHA ALLAH</b>.</em>
        <br>
